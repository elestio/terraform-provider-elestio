# Elestio Provider

<img src="https://elest.io/images/elestio.svg" width="100" height="100" />

[Elestio](https://elest.io/) is a fully managed DevOps platform to deploy your code and open-source software.

The Elestio Provider allows you to deploy your services with Terraform.
You must have an active account with Elestio.
[Pricing](https://elest.io/pricing) and [Signup](https://dash.elest.io/signup) informations can be found on Elestio website https://elest.io/.

&larr; The navigation menu to the left provides details about the resources that you can interact with (Resources), and a guide (Guides) for how you can get started.

## Example Usage

Terraform `0.13` and later:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    elestio = {
      source = "elestio/elestio"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the provider
provider "elestio" {
  email     = "<elestio_email>"
  api_token = "<elestio_api_token>"
}

# Create a project
resource "elestio_project" "project" {
  name = "Demo"
}

# Create a postgresql service
resource "elestio_postgresql" "database" {
  project_id    = elestio_project.project.id
  provider_name = "hetzner"
  datacenter    = "fsn1"
  server_type   = "MEDIUM-2C-4G"
}
```

## Authentication

The Elestio provider offers a credentials (email and API token) based method for authentication.
You can find your API token on your [account security page](https://dash.elest.io/account/security).

The following methods are supported :

- Static credentials
- Environment variables

### Static Credentials

Static credentials can be provided by adding an `email` and `api_token` arguments in the Elestio provider block:

```terraform
provider "elestio" {
  email     = "<elestio_email>"
  api_token = "<elestio_api_token>"
}
```

!> **Warning:** Hardcoding credentials into a Terraform configuration is not recommended. Hardcoded credentials increase the risk of accidentally publishing secrets to public repositories.

### Environment Variables

Run the following commands to set the `ELESTIO_EMAIL` and `ELESTIO_API_TOKEN` environment variables:

```sh
$ export ELESTIO_EMAIL="<elestio_email>"
$ export ELESTIO_API_TOKEN="<elestio_api_token>"
```

-> **Note:** Quotation marks are required around the email and API token secret strings.

When using this method, you may omit the Elestio `provider` block entirely:

```terraform
# You can omit the provider block
# provider "elestio" {}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `api_token` (String, Sensitive) Elestio API token. You can find this token in the [security settings](https://dash.elest.io/account/security) of your account.
- `email` (String) Elestio email address. This is the email address with which you registered on the [Elestio website](https://dash.elest.io/).

## Secrets and Terraform state

Some resources that can be created with this provider, like `elestio_service.env`, are
considered "secrets", and as such are marked by this provider as _sensitive_, so to
help practitioner to not accidentally leak their value in logs or other form of output.

It's important to remember that the values that constitute the "state" of those
resources will be stored in the [Terraform state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state) file.
This includes the "secrets", that will be part of the state file *unencrypted*.

Because of these limitations, **use of these resources for production deployments is _not_ recommended**.
Failing that, **protecting the content of the state file is strongly recommended**.

The more general advice is that it's better to generate "secrets" outside of Terraform,
and then distribute them securely to the system where Terraform will make use of them.
