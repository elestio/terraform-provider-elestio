# Elestio Provider

<img src="https://elest.io/images/elestio.svg" width="100" height="100" />

[Elestio](https://elest.io/) is a fully managed DevOps platform to deploy your code and open-source software.

The Elestio provider is used to interact with the API services provided by Elestio.

In order to use this Provider, you must have an active account with Elestio.
[Pricing](https://elest.io/pricing) and signup information can be found at https://dash.elest.io/signup.

**&larr; Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.**

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Terraform 0.13+ requires providers to be declared in a "required_providers" block
terraform {
  required_providers {
    elestio = {
      source  = "elestio/elestio"
      version = "1.0.0" # check out the latest version in the release section
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Elestio Provider
provider "elestio" {
  email     = "YOUR-EMAIL"
  api_token = "YOUR-API-TOKEN"
}

# Create a Project
resource "elestio_project" "myawesomeproject" {
  name = "Awesome project"

  # ...
}
```

## Authentication

The Elestio provider offers a credentials (email and API token) based method for authentication.
You can find your API token on your account security page: https://dash.elest.io/account/security

The following methods are supported :
- Static arguments
- Environment variables

### Static arguments

Static credentials can be provided by adding an `email` and `api_token` arguments in the Elestio provider block:

```terraform
provider "elestio" {
  email     = "YOUR-EMAIL"
  api_token = "YOUR-API-TOKEN"
}

resource "elestio_project" "myproject" {
  # ...
}
```

Usage:

```sh
$ terraform plan
```

### Environment variables

You can provide your email by `ELESTIO_EMAIL` and your API token via `ELESTIO_API_TOKEN` environment variables. 
When using this method, you may omit the Elestio `provider` block entirely:

```terraform
# You can omit the provider block
# provider "elestio" {}

resource "elestio_service" "myservice" {
  # ...
}
```

Usage:

```sh
$ export ELESTIO_EMAIL="elestioemail"
$ export ELESTIO_API_TOKEN="elestioapitoken"
$ terraform plan
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `api_token` (String, Sensitive) Elestio API token. You can find this token in the [security settings](https://dash.elest.io/account/security) of your account.
- `email` (String) Elestio email address. This is the email address with which you registered on the [Elestio website](https://dash.elest.io/).

## Secrets and Terraform state

Some resources that can be created with this provider, like `elestio_service.env`, are
considered "secrets", and as such are marked by this provider as _sensitive_, so to
help practitioner to not accidentally leak their value in logs or other form of output.

It's important to remember that the values that constitute the "state" of those
resources will be stored in the [Terraform state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state) file.
This includes the "secrets", that will be part of the state file *unencrypted*.

Because of these limitations, **use of these resources for production deployments is _not_ recommended**.
Failing that, **protecting the content of the state file is strongly recommended**.

The more general advice is that it's better to generate "secrets" outside of Terraform,
and then distribute them securely to the system where Terraform will make use of them.
