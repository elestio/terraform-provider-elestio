# Providers, datacenters and server types

This guide explain how to find available options for `provider_name`, `datacenter` and `server_type` variables when you want to manage a service resource with terraform.

```tf
resource "elestio_vault" "my_vault" {
  // ..
  provider_name = "netcup" 
  datacenter    = "nbg"
  server_type   = "MEDIUM-2C-4G"
  // ...
}
```

## Common Providers

Here are the common cloud providers currently supported by Elestio and their corresponding `provider_name` values (must be lowercase):

**Note:** This list may change as new providers are added or existing ones are updated. For the most up-to-date information, use the method described in the "Listing all options" section below.

| Provider Name | Full Name |
|---------------|-----------|
| `hetzner` | Hetzner Cloud |
| `do` | Digital Ocean |
| `lightsail` | Amazon Lightsail |
| `linode` | Linode Cloud |
| `vultr` | Vultr Cloud |
| `scaleway` | Scaleway Cloud |
| `netcup` | Netcup |

**Important:** The `provider_name` must be provided in lowercase. For example, use `netcup` instead of `NETCUP` or `Netcup`.

## Listing all options

When you create a service via the website, all three pieces of information (**providers**, **data centers**, and **server types**) **are listed on a single page**. You can copy the configuration from there and paste it into your Terraform file.
